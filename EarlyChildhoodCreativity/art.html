            <p>Art experiences provide young children with powerful non-verbal communication tools, allowing them to express ideas, emotions, and understandings that they may not yet have words for. Through art, children develop visual-spatial skills, fine motor control, creative problem-solving abilities, and confidence in self-expression.</p>

                <h3>Process-Based Painting</h3>
                <p><strong>Materials:</strong> Various paints (tempera, watercolor), brushes of different sizes, sponges, stamps, rollers</p>
                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Set up multiple stations with different painting tools. Allow children to move freely between stations, mixing colors and experimenting with application methods. Focus conversation on their process ("Tell me about how you made these marks") rather than asking "What is it?"</p>
                <p><strong>Extensions:</strong> Add texture materials (sand, salt) to paint; paint to music; collaborative mural painting</p>

                <h3>Found Object Sculptures</h3>
                <p><strong>Materials:</strong> Recycled materials (boxes, tubes, bottle caps), glue, tape, scissors, paint</p>
                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Provide a variety of materials and challenge children to create three-dimensional structures. Encourage them to think about balance, stability, and how different materials connect.</p>
                <p><strong>Extensions:</strong> Create sculptures based on story characters; build structures that can move (mobiles); collaborative installation art</p>
